We did constant folding at the Ast level.  We also did code removal.

We folded arithmetic expressions and removed useless if statements, and while loops.

We modified optast.ml to fold constants to make the output program shorter.

We modified the file to print the program before and after the optimizations.  You can see the
output code is shorter, therefore we have smaller file sizes and make the code
more space efficient.
